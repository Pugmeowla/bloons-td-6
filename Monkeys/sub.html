    Monkey Sub is a Military-class tower in Bloons TD 6. The tower retains its name and role from the Bloons TD 5 Generation, with significant additions. It received a select few teasers prior to the game's release, one of them being an in-game showcase of a 2-0-0 Sub on Spice Islands and Streambed interacting with Line of Sight.
  </p2>
<br>
<br>
<p2>
  Monkey Subs shoot homing darts with moderate seeking every 0.75s, popping up to two bloons each by default. It can gain unique benefits that greatly assist its overall cost-effective power, including a unique extensible range upgrade, the option to submerge, and unstoppable missile-launching at incoming blimps. It is also one of two fully aquatic non-hero water towers in the game, the other being Monkey Buccaneer.

<br>

<p2>It costs $275 on Easy, $325 on Medium, $350 on Hard, and $390 on Impoppable by default.</p2>
