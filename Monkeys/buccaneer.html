    Monkey Buccaneer is a Military-class tower in Bloons TD 6. The tower retains its name and role from the Bloons TD 4 and 5 Generation, with significant additions. It did not receive any teasers prior to release, but it was first shown when the game was available to select YouTubers several days before BTD6's official release date.

  A Monkey Buccaneer is a monkey within a wooden boat equipped with two cannons on each side that fire darts every second. The tower is a unique water-based tower that has an upgrade that proficiently provides cash, similar to a Banana Farm, but on water. It is one of the three non-hero towers that is able to instakill MOAB-Class Bloons in their entirety, with the other being Engineer Monkeys and Beast Handlers. It is also one of two fully aquatic non-hero water-based towers, the other being Monkey Subs.
