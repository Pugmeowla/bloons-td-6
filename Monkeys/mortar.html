    The Mortar Monkey is a Military-class tower that arrived in update 6.0 of Bloons TD 6 on September 17, 2018. The tower retains its role from the Bloons TD 4 and 5 Generation, with many new features and modifications, including a name change from "Mortar Tower" (although named "Mortar Monkey" in Bloons Monkey City). It was first teased on Twitter at November 16th, 2018, just a few days before Version 6.0 was released.</p2>
<br>
<br>
<p2>Mortar Monkeys launch explosive shells at any location on the map as set by the target reticle. At base, it attacks slowly and inaccurately, but packs a massive 2 damage per explosion with a large base pierce of 25 per explosion, and starts off with a blast radius of 20. The base Mortar has a projectile deviation radius of 18, meaning its shots will be centered anywhere around an 18 range radius from the center of the target reticle. It attacks every 2.0s, and each shell has a 0.5s deploy time between firing from the barrel and hitting the shell onto the ground.</p2>
<br>
<br>
<p2>When micromanaged properly, the Mortar Monkey is a powerful versatile long-ranged explosive tower. It comes with various upgrades to assist its power such as extraordinarily large and deadly explosions, hypersonic attack speed, stunning waves of shells, and utterly devastating incineration. It is also the only tower able to liberate the Cave Monkey. </p2>
<p2>It costs $640 on Easy, $750 on Medium, $810 on Hard, and $900 on Impoppable by default.</p2>
