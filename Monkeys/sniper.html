  <p2>Sniper Monkey is a Military-class tower in Bloons TD 6. The tower remains its name and role from the Bloons TD 5 Generation, with significant additions. It received several teasers prior to release, showing a base Sniper interacting with Line of Sight on Hedge and Town Center.</p2>
<br>
<br>
<p2>Sniper Monkeys wield a long-range rifle and can attack a bloon anywhere on the map, assuming clear Line of Sight. Compared to other towers, the Sniper Monkey's main role is in single target damage as it initially deals 2 damage to one bloon at a time. In Bloons TD 6, the Sniper Monkey now has access to gaining more than one pierce per attack via upgrades like Shrapnel Shot which adds a five-sprayed shrapnel attack, and Bouncing Bullet which allows bullets to bounce onto up to 3 different bloons.</p2>
<br>
<br>

<p2>It costs $300 on Easy, $350 on Medium, $380 on Hard, and $420 on Impoppable by default.</p2>
